I’m very happy to announce that Geoffrey Grosenbach, from TopFunky/Peepcode, kindly offered to support my weblog! I can’t express how much I appreciate this as it indicates that I am in the right direction. I’ve always recommended Peepcode screencasts because they are high quality and I will still recommend them for the same reason: quality. Actually I bought every single item they released so far and enjoyed them all.
Geoffrey also supports many other great blogs like Ryan Daigle, Wanstrath & Hyett, which are great.
I’ll finally be able to replace that ugly Google ads with something way more meaningful now. There are still remaining details between us, but as Geoffrey is someone I totally trust, I decided to already take the Google ads off right away.
Thanks Geoffrey!
