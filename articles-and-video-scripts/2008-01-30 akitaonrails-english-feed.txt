Hello folks! Finally, I added an English-only feed for all of you that only read english articles. For all of you that donâ€™t know it: this is a brazilian portuguese oriented website, but I often write articles in both languages. Now you can subscribe to the feed that will notify you of english-written articles only. Rejoice!
