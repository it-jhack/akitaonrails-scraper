A few weeks ago I’ve asked on Twitter for Brazilian websites made with Ruby on Rails or international websites that had Brazilian developers working on it. So I’ve organized a small gallery. Click on the screenshots to visit them.
I’ll be updating this page from time to time, so if you have other websites to refer to, please email me with a 150×91 thumbnail and the URL to the website.
