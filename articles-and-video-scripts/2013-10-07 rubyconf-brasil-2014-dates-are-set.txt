To be sure everybody starts getting prepared: Rubyconf Brasil 2014 is already confirmed with venue and dates.
It's going to be August 28th and 29th, 2014. The venue will the Frei Caneca Theater, just like 2013. We were checking new locations, but the difficulties in closer restaurants, parking lots, etc made us go back to the same place of 2013. It's large, it's structured well enough, we know how to make it work and it fits more than 800 people comfortably.
Buying plane tickets and hotel reservations ahead of time make it much cheaper. So you can be assured of the dates and location already.
If your company wants to participate, sponsor, send you as a speaker or anything like that, let me know. Call for Papers will open next year around March or April.
See you all next year (The Rubyconf Brasil Staff)
