What can I say? I am not from the United States of America. I am not at all into politics (this blog is not about politics). But for some reason Iâ€™ve been cheering for Obama since the beginning of the US campaign and I am very very satisfied tonight.

Hope he can live up to his promises. His winning speech was perfect: not at all cheering, but sober and serious, about hope and unit. I just wish we had politians like him here. McCain was the safety bet, Obama was the dubious newcomer. Messages of renewal and change with a good dose of reality-check are always welcome.
Congrats for the USA for this great step forward.
