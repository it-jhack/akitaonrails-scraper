So, Rails 5.0.0 Beta 1 has just been released and the main new feature is Action Cable.
It's basically a complete solution on top of vanilla Rails so you can implement WebSocket based applications (the usual real time chats and notifications) with full access to your Rails assets (models, view templates, etc). For small to medium apps, this is a terrific solution that you might want to use instead of having to go to Node.js.
In summary you control Cable Channels that can receive messages sent through a WebSocket client wiring. The new Channel generator takes care of the boilerplate and you just have to fill in the blanks for what kinds of messages you want to send from the client, what you want to broadcast from the server, and to what channels that your clients are subscribed to.
For a more in-depth introduction, DHH himself published a bare bone Action Cable screencast that you should watch just to get a feeling of what the fuzz is all about. If you watched it already and have experience in programming, you may have spotted the problem I mention in the title, so just jump to "The Problem" section below for a TL;DR.
In the end you will end up with a code base like the one I reproduced in my Github repository up until the tag "end_of_dhh". You will have a (very) bare bone single-room real time chat app for you to play with the main components.



Let's just list the main components here. First, you will have the ActionCable server mounted in the "routes.rb" file:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: 'rooms#show'

  # Serve websocket cable requests in-process
  mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'
end


This is the main server component, the channel:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14

# app/channels/room_channel.rb
class RoomChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "room_channel"
  end

  def unsubscribed
    # Any cleanup needed when channel is unsubscribed
  end

  def speak(data)
    Message.create! content: data['message']
  end
end


Then you have the boilerplace Javascript:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

# app/assets/javascripts/cable.coffee
#= require action_cable
#= require_self
#= require_tree ./channels
#
@App ||= {}
App.cable = ActionCable.createConsumer()


And the main client-side Websocket hooks:

7

9
10
11
12
13
14

# app/assets/javascripts/channels/room.coffee
App.room = App.cable.subscriptions.create "RoomChannel",
  connected: ->
    # Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server

  disconnected: ->
    # Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server

  received: (data) ->
    $('#messages').append data['message']

  speak: (message) ->
    @perform 'speak', message: message

$(document).on "keypress", "[data-behavior~=room_speaker]", (event) ->
  if event.keyCode is 13
    App.room.speak event.target.value
    event.target.value = ''
    event.preventDefault()


The view template is a bare bone HTML just to hook a simple form and div to list the messages:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

<!-- app/views/rooms/show.html.erb -->
<h1>Chat room</h1>

<div id="messages">
  <%= render @messages %>
</div>

<form>
  <label>Say something:</label><br>
  <input type="text" data-behavior="room_speaker">
</form>



The Problem
In the "RoomChannel", you have the "speak" method that saves a message to the database. This is already a red flag for a WebSocket action that is supposed to have very short lived, light processing. Saving to the database is to be considered heavyweight, specially under load. If this is processed inside EventMachine's reactor loop, it will block the loop and avoid other concurrent processing to take place until the database releases the lock.

4
5
6
7

# app/channels/room_channel.rb
class RoomChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  ...
  def speak(data)
    Message.create! content: data['message']
  end
end


I would say that anything that goes inside the channel should be asynchronous!
To add harm to injury, this is what you have in the "Message" model itself:

1
2
3

class Message < ApplicationRecord
  after_create_commit { MessageBroadcastJob.perform_later self }
end


A model callback (avoid those as the plague!!) to broadcast the received messsage to the subscribed Websocket clients as an ActiveJob that looks like this:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13

class MessageBroadcastJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(message)
    ActionCable.server.broadcast  'room_channel', message: render_message(message)
  end

  private

  def render_message(message)
    ApplicationController.renderer.render(partial: 'messages/message', locals: { message: message })
  end
end


It renders the HTML snippet to send back for the Websocket clients to append to their browser DOMs.
DHH even goes on to say "I'd like to show it because this is how most apps will end up."
Indeed, the problem is that most people will just follow this pattern and it's a big trap. So, what's the solution instead?
The Proper Solution
For just the purposes of a simple screencast, let's make a quick fix.
First of all, if at all possible you want your channel code to block as little as possible. Waiting for a blocking operation in the database (writing) is definitely not one of them. The Job is underused, it should be called straight from the channel "speak" method, like this:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

# app/channels/room_channel.rb
 class RoomChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
   ...
   def speak(data)
-    Message.create! content: data['message']
+    MessageBroadcastJob.perform_later data['message']
   end
 end


Then, we move the model writing to the Job itself:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

# app/jobs/message_broadcast_job.rb
 class MessageBroadcastJob < ApplicationJob
   queue_as :default

-  def perform(message)
-    ActionCable.server.broadcast  'room_channel', message: render_message(message)
+  def perform(data)
+    message = Message.create! content: data
+    ActionCable.server.broadcast 'room_channel', message: render_message(message)
   end
   ...


And finally, we remove that horrible callback from the model and make it bare-bone again:

1
2
3

# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ApplicationRecord
end


This returns quickly, defer processing to a background job and should sustain more concurrency out-of-the-box. The previous, DHH solution, have a built-in bottleneck in the speak method and will choke as soon as the database becomes the bottleneck.
It's by no means a perfect solution yet, but it's less terrible for a very quick demo and the code ends up being simpler as well. You can check out this code in my Github repo commit.
I may be wrong in the conclusion that the channel will block or if this is indeed harmful for the concurrency. I didn't measure both solutions, it's just a gut feeling from older wounds. If you have more insight into the implementation of Action Cable, leave a comment down below.
By the way, be careful before considering migrating your Rails 4.2 app to Rails 5 just yet. Because of the hard coded dependencies on Faye, Eventmachine, Rails 5 right now rules out Unicorn (even Thin seems to be having problem booting up). It also rules out JRuby and MRI on Windows as well because of Eventmachine.
If you want the capabilities of Action Cable without having to migrate, you can use solutions such as "Pusher.com", or if you want your own in-house solution, follow my evolution on the subject with my mini-Pusher clone written in Elixir.
