Hey, I finally decided to deliver a PDF version of my famous First Rails 2.0 Tutorial
So, here they go:

Part 1
Part 2

Theyâ€™re not perfect but should suffice for those of you that prefer to have an offline version.
I also just uploaded the higher quality H.264 Quicktime video for you to download directly through Rapidshare.
Rejoice!
