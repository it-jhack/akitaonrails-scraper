## About Fabio Akita
Fabio Akita is an experienced developer and entrepreneur at Codeminer42. He has been a developer since the early 90s, posting articles on his blog since 2006, and posting YouTube videos since 2018. Fabio addresses a wide range of topics, from theoretical concepts to career and life advice. Using his extensive experience as example, he gives insightful lessons for beginners and professionals about software development and team management.

I find his content to be very unique from the perspective of a Senior Developer and Software Entrepreneur who speaks his mind and doesn't minimally care what others will think. In many occasions he talks about all the bullshðŸ’©t roaming around the software development market. If you listen closely, you might avoid a lot of headaches in your career. 

> The original content is mostly in Brazilian Portuguese. I've been trying to use AI to translate and summarize it, but I hadn't been satisfied with the results. I might translate, summarize and make public some of his best content in the near future.

## Why this scraper?

Fabio has amassed a substantial collection of articles and videos over the years. Sometimes I want to review a specific topic or case, but finding them can be challenging. The parsed articles and video scripts in this repository make it easy for me to `grep` what I need.
